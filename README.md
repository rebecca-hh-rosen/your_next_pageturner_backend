# Your Next Page Turner (backend)

Your Next Page Turner is a book recommendation system that sources from the top 200 books of the last 200 years, as determined by Goodreads users and data. 

Information on nearly 20,000 books - including title, author, description and cover image -  was scraped from Goodreads in January 2020 using Selenium. Details on the scraping process can be found in the file entitled "clean_scrape.ipynb".

The present recommendation system implements a content-based model to suggest books based on the similarity scores of their associated "bag of words". Details on this process can be found throughout the "cleaning_and_eda.ipynb" file, as well as in the "book_functions.py" file.



The resulting recommendation system is currently implemented and running through a Flask/Yarn enabled frontend, as a collaboration with software engineer, James Sharpe. This can be found at http://jameswrightsharpe.me/your-next-page-turner/.


 

Enjoy, and read on!
