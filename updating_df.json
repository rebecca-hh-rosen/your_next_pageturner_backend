But to make it a lucrative farming state, much of the land had to be deforested, leaving behind devastated habitats. The Limberlost, a wetland in northern Indiana, was mostly destroyed by drainage, logging and oil production. Gene Stratton-Porter, an early 20th-century naturalist and novelist, captured the fading beauty of the swamp in books like A Girl of the Limberlost, a novel about a smart, ambitious girl who lives in the dwindling wetland with her mother and pays for school by collecting local moth specimens to sell to naturalists.

This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.  Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel\u2019s plot.  In Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Ch\u0142opi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.","format":"hardcover","genre":"European Literature, Polish Literature, Classics, Fiction, Academic, School","id":1841723,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1189074060l\/1841723.jpg","isbn":null,"key_words":"repeatable rhythm suggestive picture reality peasants \u2014 autumn published material customs behaviour spiritual culture composition calendar richness doctrines fact authenticity knowledge four parts represents didactic exemplifications write village doctrinal ideas eternal colourful country community believe people tetralogy strict simplicity polish villages plot mentality early th century historical events rather life parallel reader winter spring took place various volumes signal repertoire described sense functionality boundaries reymont placed ch\u0142opi novel astonishes biblical books relationship human division underlines significant influence peasant regulates greek myths complete nature decided created compared impresses writer summer season brought experience religion one vegetational cycle titles also \u2019 author sharply drawn individual portraits","num_ratings":"2,781 ratings","page":616.0,"ratings":3.16,"titles":null,"tot_rating":null,"year_pub":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"P.G.

The narrator, Knut Pedersen (Hamsun's real name), is an unsimple character in search of the simple life, which he hopes to attain by wandering round the Norwegian countryside doing such work as he can find. His quest is continually frustrated, not least by his susceptibility to the wives and daughters of successive employers.  In Under the Autumn Star he joins forces first with Grindhusen, a man blessed with the faith that \"something will turn up\"; later with Lars Falkenberg, whose dubious talents include the tuning of pianos. Knut and Lars end up as workmen on the estate of a certain Captain Falkenberg (no relation), with whose wife each falls in love. In due course, Knut is laid off and, in futile pursuit of the woman with whom by now he is helplessly infatuated, eventually finds himself sucked back into the city he once fled.  \"A wanderer plays on muted strings,\" explains Knut, now six years older, \"when he reaches the age of two score years and ten.\" Among this sequel's qualities is the poignancy with which it conveys that sense of aging.

Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.   This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.  Two years after publication of this \"extract,\" originally planned as a six-chapter book, Twain himself shipped off to follow in Captain Stormfield's wake.","format":"paperback","genre":"Classics, Fiction, Humor, Short Stories, Literature, Fantasy, Literature, American","id":453751,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1365462955l\/453751.jpg","isbn":9781591020240.0,"key_words":"captain stormfields wake last published work universe paradise talk grand scheme discovery produced two years fact cloud strumming reflect view sailors jargon twain recently deceased stormfield earth merchant marine describes reveal next world sitting afterlife seems day turns point insufferably boring outnumber whites plot begun extract originally planned folksy narration peppered six chapter book known really like beginning insignificance eternally youthful also native americans importance things th century outer space feelings told main character huge expanse species north american district twains witty vision actual sea become inadequate humorous new scientific awareness awesome cosmos trouble finding someone confronts us shipped amiable altogether average white anglo saxon male characteristics astronomy outlandish dimensions publication heaven utterly explode every human conception follow insipid teenagers mark harp inspired series amusingly disconcerting revelations finds mixing well pretensions dream crowd traditional religious concepts place funny satirical spoof drawbacks","num_ratings":"569 ratings","page":153.0,"ratings":3.87,"titles":null,"tot_rating":null,"year_pub":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"Arnold Bennett","avg_rating":null,"bow":"arnoldbennett nonfiction classics writing booksaboutbooks writing essays literature criticism literarycriticism great grandfathers opportunity first years old wives tale theme detailed instructions literary work popular better modern times man essentially pointed rage journalist benefit produced many self improvement books st century probably much good often knowledge collecting still worth complete library study remember widely read ordinary working class people era english literarure came respected authors successful publication way th clayhanger trilogy book britain seem rather quaint generation value started bearing form mind card category appeared heyday free education sought one arnold bennett power taste time sub title famous works included","description":"Arnold Bennett is probably not widely read in the 21st century, but in his heyday during the first 30 years of the 20th century he was one of the most popular and most respected authors in Britain, and his most famous works included The Old Wives' Tale, the Clayhanger Trilogy, and The Card. He was essentially a literary man, but he started out as a journalist and in his time he produced many self-improvement books such as were all the rage as more and more ordinary working-class people (having started to benefit from free education) sought the opportunity to better themselves in an era when the theme was often 'knowledge is power\".

Ambrose Bierce is best known for The Devil's Dictionary, but the prolific journalist, satirist, and fabulist was also a usage maven. In 1909, he published several hundred of his pet peeves in Write It Right: A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults.  Bierce's list includes some distinctions still familiar today--the which-that rule, less vs. fewer, lie and lay -- but it also abounds in now-forgotten shibboleths: Ovation, the critics of his time agreed, meant a Roman triumph, not a round of applause. Reliable was an ill-formed coinage, not for the discriminating. Donate was pretentious, jeopardize should be jeopard, demean meant \"comport oneself,\" not \"belittle.\" And Bierce made up a few peeves of his own for good measure. We should say \"a coating of paint,\" he instructed, not \"a coat.\"  To mark the 100th anniversary of Write It Right, language columnist Jan Freeman has investigated where Bierce's rules and taboos originated, how they've fared in the century since the blacklist, and what lies ahead. Will our language quibbles seem as odd in 2109 as Bierce's do today? From the evidence offered here, it looks like a very good bet.","format":"hardcover","genre":"Nonfiction, Language, Writing, Reference, Humanities, Language","id":6815365,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1312026449l\/6815365.jpg","isbn":9780802717689.0,"key_words":"bierces right th anniversary paint devils dictionary time agreed meant rules fabulist write evidence offered mbrose classic catalog round century since instructed language columnist jan freeman best known annotated edition theyve fared lies ahead coat odd pet peeves mark prolific journalist satirist literary faults list includes little blacklist today published several hundred discriminating donate also good measure bet forgotten shibboleths ovation say correct speech ambrose bierce critics distinctions still familiar coating lay one rule less vs fewer lie applause reliable ill formed coinage looks like pretentious jeopardize roman triumph made abounds americas foremost experts presents taboos originated investigated jeopard demean comport oneself quibbles seem usage maven belittle","num_ratings":"151 ratings","page":240.0,"ratings":3.82,"titles":null,"tot_rating":null,"year_pub":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"R.

A resourceful heroine, Diantha quickly expands her business into an enterprise that includes a maid service, cooked food delivery service, restaurant, and hotel. By assigning a cash value to women\u2019s \u201cinvisible\u201d work, providing a means for the well-being and moral uplift of working girls, and releasing middle-class and leisure-class women from the burden of conventional domestic chores, Diantha proves to her family and community the benefits of professionalized housekeeping.

She illuminates the novel\u2019s connections to Gilman\u2019s other feminist works, including \u201cThe Yellow Wall-Paper\u201d and Herland; to her personal life; and to her commitment to women\u2019s social and economic freedom.

Henry is the pen name of American writer William Sydney Porter (1862-1910). Porter's 400 short stories are known for their wit, wordplay, characterization and the clever use of twist endings. He travelled to Austin in 1884, where he took a number of different jobs over the next several years, first as pharmacist then as a draftsman, bank teller and journalist. He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization and plot twists were adored by his readers, but often panned by the critics. Yet, he went on to gain international recognition and is credited with defining the short story as a literary art form. His works include: Cabbages and Kings (1904), The Four Million (1906), Heart of the West (1907), The Trimmed Lamp and Other Stories of the Four Million (1907), The Voice of the City: Further Stories of the Four Million (1908), The Gentle Grafter (1908) and Roads of Destiny (1909).","format":"paperback","genre":"Short Stories, Classics, Fiction, Classics, Classic Literature","id":6435452,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348172752l\/6435452.jpg","isbn":9781406594324.0,"key_words":"draftsman bank teller known gain international recognition story wrote critics yet took new york city often panned journalist prolific writing period started four million heart roads travelled living stories number different jobs sideline clever use short gentle grafter adored defining publishers next several years first destiny near pharmacist also began employment porters american writer william sydney porter wit wordplay characterization year week went credited trimmed lamp henry austin plot twists works include cabbages moved pen name twist endings world sunday magazine kings voice readers west literary art form","num_ratings":"74 ratings","page":188.0,"ratings":3.99,"titles":null,"tot_rating":null,"year_pub":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"O.

But to make it a lucrative farming state, much of the land had to be deforested, leaving behind devastated habitats. The Limberlost, a wetland in northern Indiana, was mostly destroyed by drainage, logging and oil production. Gene Stratton-Porter, an early 20th-century naturalist and novelist, captured the fading beauty of the swamp in books like A Girl of the Limberlost, a novel about a smart, ambitious girl who lives in the dwindling wetland with her mother and pays for school by collecting local moth specimens to sell to naturalists.

K. Chesterton's fiction, The Ball and the Cross is both witty and profound, cloaking serious religious and philosophical inquiry in sparkling humor and whimsy. Serialized in the British publication The Commonwealth in 1905-06, Chesterton's second novel first appeared in book form in America in 1909, delighting and challenging readers with its heady mixture of fantasy, farce, and theology.

Martin Gardner's superb introduction to The Ball and the Cross reveals the real-life debate between Chesterton and a famous atheist that provided inspiration for the story, and it explores some of the novel's possible allegorical meanings.

This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.  Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel\u2019s plot.  In Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Ch\u0142opi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.","format":"hardcover","genre":"European Literature, Polish Literature, Classics, Fiction, Academic, School","id":1841723,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1189074060l\/1841723.jpg","isbn":null,"key_words":"repeatable rhythm suggestive picture reality peasants \u2014 autumn published material customs behaviour spiritual culture composition calendar richness doctrines fact authenticity knowledge four parts represents didactic exemplifications write village doctrinal ideas eternal colourful country community believe people tetralogy strict simplicity polish villages plot mentality early th century historical events rather life parallel reader winter spring took place various volumes signal repertoire described sense functionality boundaries reymont placed ch\u0142opi novel astonishes biblical books relationship human division underlines significant influence peasant regulates greek myths complete nature decided created compared impresses writer summer season brought experience religion one vegetational cycle titles also \u2019 author sharply drawn individual portraits","num_ratings":"2,781 ratings","page":616.0,"ratings":3.16,"titles":"Ch\u0142opi","tot_rating":null,"year_pub":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"P.G.

His quest is continually frustrated, not least by his susceptibility to the wives and daughters of successive employers.  In Under the Autumn Star he joins forces first with Grindhusen, a man blessed with the faith that \"something will turn up\"; later with Lars Falkenberg, whose dubious talents include the tuning of pianos. Knut and Lars end up as workmen on the estate of a certain Captain Falkenberg (no relation), with whose wife each falls in love. In due course, Knut is laid off and, in futile pursuit of the woman with whom by now he is helplessly infatuated, eventually finds himself sucked back into the city he once fled.  \"A wanderer plays on muted strings,\" explains Knut, now six years older, \"when he reaches the age of two score years and ten.\" Among this sequel's qualities is the poignancy with which it conveys that sense of aging.

In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world.   Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.   This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.

He was essentially a literary man, but he started out as a journalist and in his time he produced many self-improvement books such as were all the rage as more and more ordinary working-class people (having started to benefit from free education) sought the opportunity to better themselves in an era when the theme was often 'knowledge is power\".

Ambrose Bierce is best known for The Devil's Dictionary, but the prolific journalist, satirist, and fabulist was also a usage maven. In 1909, he published several hundred of his pet peeves in Write It Right: A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults.  Bierce's list includes some distinctions still familiar today--the which-that rule, less vs. fewer, lie and lay -- but it also abounds in now-forgotten shibboleths: Ovation, the critics of his time agreed, meant a Roman triumph, not a round of applause. Reliable was an ill-formed coinage, not for the discriminating. Donate was pretentious, jeopardize should be jeopard, demean meant \"comport oneself,\" not \"belittle.\" And Bierce made up a few peeves of his own for good measure. We should say \"a coating of paint,\" he instructed, not \"a coat.\"  To mark the 100th anniversary of Write It Right, language columnist Jan Freeman has investigated where Bierce's rules and taboos originated, how they've fared in the century since the blacklist, and what lies ahead. Will our language quibbles seem as odd in 2109 as Bierce's do today?

First published serially in Gilman\u2019s magazine The Forerunner in 1909\u201310, the novel tells the story of Diantha Bell, a young woman who leaves her home and her fianc\u00e9 to start a housecleaning business. A resourceful heroine, Diantha quickly expands her business into an enterprise that includes a maid service, cooked food delivery service, restaurant, and hotel. By assigning a cash value to women\u2019s \u201cinvisible\u201d work, providing a means for the well-being and moral uplift of working girls, and releasing middle-class and leisure-class women from the burden of conventional domestic chores, Diantha proves to her family and community the benefits of professionalized housekeeping. In her introduction to the novel, Charlotte J. Rich highlights Gilman\u2019s engagement with such hotly debated Progressive Era issues as the \u201cservant question,\u201d the rise of domestic science, and middle-class efforts to protect and aid the working girl.

However, despite the importance of the Quaterman books, many of Haggard's other novels are interesting in their own right.

Henry is the pen name of American writer William Sydney Porter (1862-1910). Porter's 400 short stories are known for their wit, wordplay, characterization and the clever use of twist endings. He travelled to Austin in 1884, where he took a number of different jobs over the next several years, first as pharmacist then as a draftsman, bank teller and journalist. He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization and plot twists were adored by his readers, but often panned by the critics. Yet, he went on to gain international recognition and is credited with defining the short story as a literary art form.

This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.  Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel\u2019s plot.  In Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Ch\u0142opi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.","format":"hardcover","genre":"European Literature, Polish Literature, Classics, Fiction, Academic, School","id":1841723,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1189074060l\/1841723.jpg","isbn":null,"key_words":"repeatable rhythm suggestive picture reality peasants \u2014 autumn published material customs behaviour spiritual culture composition calendar richness doctrines fact authenticity knowledge four parts represents didactic exemplifications write village doctrinal ideas eternal colourful country community believe people tetralogy strict simplicity polish villages plot mentality early th century historical events rather life parallel reader winter spring took place various volumes signal repertoire described sense functionality boundaries reymont placed ch\u0142opi novel astonishes biblical books relationship human division underlines significant influence peasant regulates greek myths complete nature decided created compared impresses writer summer season brought experience religion one vegetational cycle titles also \u2019 author sharply drawn individual portraits","num_ratings":"2,781 ratings","page":616.0,"ratings":3.16,"titles":"Ch\u0142opi","tot_rating":null,"year_pub":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"P.G.

The narrator, Knut Pedersen (Hamsun's real name), is an unsimple character in search of the simple life, which he hopes to attain by wandering round the Norwegian countryside doing such work as he can find. His quest is continually frustrated, not least by his susceptibility to the wives and daughters of successive employers.  In Under the Autumn Star he joins forces first with Grindhusen, a man blessed with the faith that \"something will turn up\"; later with Lars Falkenberg, whose dubious talents include the tuning of pianos. Knut and Lars end up as workmen on the estate of a certain Captain Falkenberg (no relation), with whose wife each falls in love. In due course, Knut is laid off and, in futile pursuit of the woman with whom by now he is helplessly infatuated, eventually finds himself sucked back into the city he once fled.  \"A wanderer plays on muted strings,\" explains Knut, now six years older, \"when he reaches the age of two score years and ten.\" Among this sequel's qualities is the poignancy with which it conveys that sense of aging.  Both novels show Hamsun at the height of his powers: lyrical and passionate, ironic yet deeply humane, master of one of the most original prose styles in modern literature, brilliantly translated here by Oliver and Gunnvor Stallybrass.","format":"paperback","genre":"Fiction, Classics, Novels, European Literature, Scandinavian Literature","id":32589,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348757793l\/32589.jpg","isbn":9780285647879.0,"key_words":"quest wanderer plays later two score years passionate ironic yet deeply humane master find pianos knut closely related novels daughters continually frustrated wandering round relation due course helplessly infatuated eventually finds muted strings explains whose wife age conveys hamsuns finest works susceptibility woman grindhusen workmen six older lars end hopes city original prose styles something autumn star norwegian countryside work unsimple character sense gunnvor stallybrass powers lyrical modern literature brilliantly translated falkenberg dubious talents include successive employers joins forces first oliver ten among tuning man blessed reaches futile pursuit turn search estate consists sucked back laid faith aging one attain least narrator pedersen real name sequels qualities simple life love height certain captain wives acclaimed poignancy fled falls show hamsun","num_ratings":"985 ratings","page":164.0,"ratings":3.95,"titles":"The Wanderer","tot_rating":null,"year_pub":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"Florence Louisa Barclay","avg_rating":null,"bow":"florencelouisabarclay classics romance fiction known receive mutual friend honorable jane champion go visit rosary know wants loves plain blinded gets receives news help trust doctor presumed name nurse back thereby alas pity position beauty decides great lover love beautiful story gareth dalmain falls new hunting accident","description":"\"The Rosary\" is a beautiful love story.

In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world.   Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.   This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.

He was essentially a literary man, but he started out as a journalist and in his time he produced many self-improvement books such as were all the rage as more and more ordinary working-class people (having started to benefit from free education) sought the opportunity to better themselves in an era when the theme was often 'knowledge is power\".

Ambrose Bierce is best known for The Devil's Dictionary, but the prolific journalist, satirist, and fabulist was also a usage maven. In 1909, he published several hundred of his pet peeves in Write It Right: A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults.  Bierce's list includes some distinctions still familiar today--the which-that rule, less vs. fewer, lie and lay -- but it also abounds in now-forgotten shibboleths: Ovation, the critics of his time agreed, meant a Roman triumph, not a round of applause. Reliable was an ill-formed coinage, not for the discriminating. Donate was pretentious, jeopardize should be jeopard, demean meant \"comport oneself,\" not \"belittle.\" And Bierce made up a few peeves of his own for good measure. We should say \"a coating of paint,\" he instructed, not \"a coat.\"  To mark the 100th anniversary of Write It Right, language columnist Jan Freeman has investigated where Bierce's rules and taboos originated, how they've fared in the century since the blacklist, and what lies ahead. Will our language quibbles seem as odd in 2109 as Bierce's do today?

First published serially in Gilman\u2019s magazine The Forerunner in 1909\u201310, the novel tells the story of Diantha Bell, a young woman who leaves her home and her fianc\u00e9 to start a housecleaning business. A resourceful heroine, Diantha quickly expands her business into an enterprise that includes a maid service, cooked food delivery service, restaurant, and hotel. By assigning a cash value to women\u2019s \u201cinvisible\u201d work, providing a means for the well-being and moral uplift of working girls, and releasing middle-class and leisure-class women from the burden of conventional domestic chores, Diantha proves to her family and community the benefits of professionalized housekeeping. In her introduction to the novel, Charlotte J. Rich highlights Gilman\u2019s engagement with such hotly debated Progressive Era issues as the \u201cservant question,\u201d the rise of domestic science, and middle-class efforts to protect and aid the working girl. She illuminates the novel\u2019s connections to Gilman\u2019s other feminist works, including \u201cThe Yellow Wall-Paper\u201d and Herland; to her personal life; and to her commitment to women\u2019s social and economic freedom.

However, despite the importance of the Quaterman books, many of Haggard's other novels are interesting in their own right.

He travelled to Austin in 1884, where he took a number of different jobs over the next several years, first as pharmacist then as a draftsman, bank teller and journalist. He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization and plot twists were adored by his readers, but often panned by the critics. Yet, he went on to gain international recognition and is credited with defining the short story as a literary art form.

Harassed by her mother and scorned by her peers, Elnora Comstock finds solace in natural beauty along with friendship, independence, and romance.  --  Synopsis from Huffington Post: Cornfields, soy fields, alfalfa fields \u2015 Indiana has long been seen as an agricultural plain. But to make it a lucrative farming state, much of the land had to be deforested, leaving behind devastated habitats. The Limberlost, a wetland in northern Indiana, was mostly destroyed by drainage, logging and oil production. Gene Stratton-Porter, an early 20th-century naturalist and novelist, captured the fading beauty of the swamp in books like A Girl of the Limberlost, a novel about a smart, ambitious girl who lives in the dwindling wetland with her mother and pays for school by collecting local moth specimens to sell to naturalists. The book isn\u2019t exactly an environmentalist tract, but it makes the case nonetheless: It celebrates the beauty and richness of the swampland, while showing how easily economic forces push landowners to strip it away.","format":"paperback","genre":"Classics, Fiction, Young Adult, Historical, Historical Fiction, Childrens","id":17567,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1386749079l\/17567.jpg","isbn":9781576469118.0,"key_words":"deforested leaving behind devastated habitats early th century naturalist seen \u2019 long swamp huffington post cornfields soy fields alfalfa \u2015 indiana collecting local moth specimens smart ambitious girl natural beauty along limberlost naturalists swampland set amid indianas vast romance synopsis school richness fading away struggles land drainage logging peers elnora comstock finds solace books like makes book showing growing mother make northern sell pays celebrates harassed friendship independence agricultural plain oil production gene stratton porter wetland easily economic forces push landowners lucrative farming state much lives scorned novelist captured nature strip novel dwindling environmentalist tract case nonetheless exactly treasured childrens classic mixes astute observations mostly destroyed","num_ratings":null,"page":222.0,"ratings":null,"titles":"A Girl of the Limberlost (Limberlost, #2)","tot_rating":18008.0,"year_pub":1909.0},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"Henry James","avg_rating":3.79,"bow":"henryjames classics fiction literature literature american pieces cracks dazzling virtuosity elements risk last text daughter maggie buy formerly lovers think social comedy jamess novels superstitious amerigo fearing afraid reassemble included golden bowl wedding gift try charlotte sophisticated first english edition preface grateful new introduction notes worlds classics paperback bloomsbury antique shop dont three great poetic masterpieces james combined controversial ambiguous selected variant readings know princes marriage discovered arent childhood beautiful young wife gilded future refuses later much marvel eve noble husband rich american art collector security mystery terror thing greater glory prince accept broken must leave say shattered happiness myth secret flaw","description":"'A thing to marvel at, a thing to be grateful for.'A rich American art-collector and his daughter Maggie buy in for themselves and to their greater glory a beautiful young wife and noble husband.

This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.  Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel\u2019s plot.  In Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Ch\u0142opi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.","format":"hardcover","genre":"European Literature, Polish Literature, Classics, Fiction, Academic, School","id":1841723,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1189074060l\/1841723.jpg","isbn":null,"key_words":"religion tetralogy division underlines mentality one vegetational cycle biblical books nature reymont decided fact spiritual culture various volumes signal colourful country community believe knowledge people described spring published functionality strict simplicity polish writer historical events season write brought peasant life village novel astonishes repertoire ch\u0142opi human experience richness composition author early th century created impresses material reality customs behaviour boundaries placed sharply drawn individual portraits took place reader calendar rather repeatable rhythm also complete suggestive picture eternal summer greek myths doctrines plot sense didactic exemplifications regulates \u2019 compared parallel relationship four parts represents doctrinal ideas peasants \u2014 autumn winter significant influence villages authenticity titles","num_ratings":null,"page":616.0,"ratings":null,"titles":"Ch\u0142opi","tot_rating":2783.0,"year_pub":1909.0},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"P.G.

The narrator, Knut Pedersen (Hamsun's real name), is an unsimple character in search of the simple life, which he hopes to attain by wandering round the Norwegian countryside doing such work as he can find. His quest is continually frustrated, not least by his susceptibility to the wives and daughters of successive employers.  In Under the Autumn Star he joins forces first with Grindhusen, a man blessed with the faith that \"something will turn up\"; later with Lars Falkenberg, whose dubious talents include the tuning of pianos. Knut and Lars end up as workmen on the estate of a certain Captain Falkenberg (no relation), with whose wife each falls in love. In due course, Knut is laid off and, in futile pursuit of the woman with whom by now he is helplessly infatuated, eventually finds himself sucked back into the city he once fled.  \"A wanderer plays on muted strings,\" explains Knut, now six years older, \"when he reaches the age of two score years and ten.\" Among this sequel's qualities is the poignancy with which it conveys that sense of aging.

In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world.   Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.   This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.  Two years after publication of this \"extract,\" originally planned as a six-chapter book, Twain himself shipped off to follow in Captain Stormfield's wake.","format":"paperback","genre":"Classics, Fiction, Humor, Short Stories, Literature, Fantasy, Literature, American, Religion, Humor, Comedy","id":453751,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1365462955l\/453751.jpg","isbn":9781591020240.0,"key_words":"folksy narration peppered heaven utterly explode every human conception insufferably boring pretensions fact twains witty vision view outer space drawbacks huge expanse average white anglo saxon male insipid teenagers sailors jargon grand scheme place discovery produced two years paradise things new scientific awareness mark twain captain finds species north american district feelings traditional religious concepts publication last published work reveal outlandish dimensions next world sitting known characteristics trouble finding someone talk inspired astronomy recently deceased stormfield begun awesome cosmos outnumber whites afterlife seems amiable altogether importance told become inadequate humorous really like series confronts us cloud strumming day turns th century plot six chapter book stormfields wake actual sea crowd point universe harp follow funny satirical spoof reflect mixing well dream beginning earth merchant marine describes insignificance extract originally planned main character eternally youthful also native americans amusingly disconcerting revelations shipped","num_ratings":null,"page":153.0,"ratings":null,"titles":"Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven","tot_rating":569.0,"year_pub":1909.0},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"Arnold Bennett","avg_rating":3.65,"bow":"arnoldbennett nonfiction classics writing booksaboutbooks writing essays literature criticism literarycriticism complete library theme form better bearing popular sub title rage free education sought journalist one great grandfathers mind pointed still worth seem rather quaint much good started modern times clayhanger trilogy years respected authors book detailed instructions way literary man often knowledge study remember old wives tale collecting value britain first appeared generation th century produced essentially st widely read many self improvement books time work probably successful publication ordinary working class people english literarure came category power taste card famous works included benefit opportunity heyday era arnold bennett","description":"Arnold Bennett is probably not widely read in the 21st century, but in his heyday during the first 30 years of the 20th century he was one of the most popular and most respected authors in Britain, and his most famous works included The Old Wives' Tale, the Clayhanger Trilogy, and The Card. He was essentially a literary man, but he started out as a journalist and in his time he produced many self-improvement books such as were all the rage as more and more ordinary working-class people (having started to benefit from free education) sought the opportunity to better themselves in an era when the theme was often 'knowledge is power\".

Ambrose Bierce is best known for The Devil's Dictionary, but the prolific journalist, satirist, and fabulist was also a usage maven. In 1909, he published several hundred of his pet peeves in Write It Right: A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults.  Bierce's list includes some distinctions still familiar today--the which-that rule, less vs. fewer, lie and lay -- but it also abounds in now-forgotten shibboleths: Ovation, the critics of his time agreed, meant a Roman triumph, not a round of applause. Reliable was an ill-formed coinage, not for the discriminating. Donate was pretentious, jeopardize should be jeopard, demean meant \"comport oneself,\" not \"belittle.\" And Bierce made up a few peeves of his own for good measure. We should say \"a coating of paint,\" he instructed, not \"a coat.\"  To mark the 100th anniversary of Write It Right, language columnist Jan Freeman has investigated where Bierce's rules and taboos originated, how they've fared in the century since the blacklist, and what lies ahead. Will our language quibbles seem as odd in 2109 as Bierce's do today?

Henry is the pen name of American writer William Sydney Porter (1862-1910). Porter's 400 short stories are known for their wit, wordplay, characterization and the clever use of twist endings. He travelled to Austin in 1884, where he took a number of different jobs over the next several years, first as pharmacist then as a draftsman, bank teller and journalist. He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine.

Students of folklore, readers of fantasy-quest fiction, and seekers after religious truth will all find this a vital resource.

The influence and popularity of Rilke\u2019s poetry in America have never been greater than they are today, more than fifty years after his death. Rilke is unquestionably the most significant and compelling poet of romantic transformation, of spiritual quest, that the twentieth century has known. His poems of ecstatic identification with the world exert a seemingly endless fascination for contemporary readers.  In Stephen Mitchell\u2019s versions, many readers feel that they have discovered an English rendering that captures the lyric intensity, fluency, and reach of Rilke\u2019s poetry more accurately and convincingly than has ever been done before.  Mr. Mitchell is impeccable in his adherence to Rilke\u2019s text, to his formal music, and to the complexity of his thoughts; at the same time, his work has authority and power as poetry in its own right.

Eric Marshall, recent college graduate, has the world at his feet. He\u2019s handsome, popular, wealthy, and surprisingly, single.

When an old school friend asks Eric to substitute teach for him on Prince Edward Island while he recuperates from an illness, Eric thinks, why not? He\u2019s got some time to kill before diving into the family business with his father, and the rustic island may be a good diversion for him.

If...we could ask and it could reply, it would give up to us the most intimate secrets of life. -from Chapter II Anticipating not only modern scientific theories of psychology but also those of cosmology, this astonishing book sets out a impressive goal for itself: to reconcile human biology with a theory of consciousness. First published in France in 1907, and translated into English in 1911, this work of wonder was esteemed at the time in scientific circles and in the popular culture alike for its profound explorations of perception and memory and its surprising conclusions about the nature and value of art. Contending that intuition is deeper than intellect and that the real consequence of evolution is a mental freedom to grow, to change, to seek and create novelty, Bergson reinvigorated the theory of evolution by refusing to see it as merely mechanistic. His expansion on Darwin remains one of the most original and important philosophical arguments for a scientific inquiry still under fire today.

His speculations, especially about the nature of time, had a profound influence on many other philosophers, as well as on poets and novelists; they are said to have been the seed for \u00c0 la recherce de temps perdu by Marcel Proust (whose cousin was Bergson's wife). Though his ideas were sometimes difficult to follow, Bergson was also a fine stylist, who once declared, \"there is nothing in philosophy which could not be said in everyday language,\" and who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927. In Time and Free Will, written as his doctoral thesis, Bergson tries to dispel the arguments against free will. These arguments, he shows, come from a confusion of different ideas of time. Physicists and mathematicians conceive of time as a measurable construct much like the spatial dimensions. But in human experience, life is perceived as a continuous and unmeasurable flow rather than as a succession of marked-off states of consciousness \u2014 something that can be measured not quantitatively, but only qualitatively. And because human personalities express themselves in acts that cannot be predicted, Bergson declares free will to be an observable fact. Students and teachers of philosophy are sure to welcome this inexpensive reprint of Bergson's classic, influential essay, long a staple of college philosophy courses.","format":"paperback","genre":"Philosophy, Nonfiction, Cultural, France","id":379661,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1174321069l\/379661.jpg","isbn":9781402199394.0,"key_words":"welcome spatial dimensions said philosophical thought sure marked also poets arguing internationally known france novelists human experience life bergsons classic influential essay long time physicists staple many states marcel proust whose cousin different ideas philosophers abstract methods everyday language arguments rejecting traditional conceptual intuition seed measured written almost profound influence one sometimes difficult well predicted bergson declares free confusion inexpensive reprint wife though philosophy cannot \u00e0 la recherce de temps perdu revolution personalities express mathematicians conceive intellect day observable fact students succession continuous literature qualitatively lectures drew huge crowds henri led quantitatively measurable construct much like college courses shows come consciousness \u2014 something nothing follow acts teachers fine stylist dispel deeper could unmeasurable flow rather cult figure nature declared nobel prize doctoral thesis tries perceived awarded speculations especially","num_ratings":null,"page":278.0,"ratings":null,"titles":"Time and Free Will","tot_rating":538.0,"year_pub":"1910"},{"au_ge":"thorntonwburgess childrens classics fiction animals","authors":"Thornton W.
