Her short story, \"A Jury of Her Peers\", was adapted from the play a year after its debut. It was first performed by the Provincetown Players at the Wharf Theatre in Provincetown, Massachusetts on August 8, 1916. In the original play, Glaspell played the role of one of the characters, Mrs. Hale. It is frequently anthologized in American literature textbooks.  The play begins as the county attorney, the sherrif, Mr. Hale, Mrs. Peters, and Mrs. Hale enter the Wright's empty farm house. On prompting from the county attorney, Mr. Hale recounts his visit to the house the previous day, when he found Mrs. Wright behaving strangely and found her husband upstairs with a rope around his neck, dead. Mr. Hale notes that, when he questioned her, Mrs. Wright claimed that she was fast asleep when someone strangled her husband.  Often hailed as one of the quintessential feminist plays, 'Trifles' earned Glaspell a Pulitzer Prize and renewed literary recognition.

For the group of ordinary men in the French Sixth Battalion, thrown together from all over France and longing for home, war is simply a matter of survival, lightened only by the arrival of their rations or a glimpse of a pretty girl or a brief reprieve in the hospital. Reminiscent of classics like Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, Under Fire (originally published in French as La Feu) vividly evokes life in the trenches: the mud, stench, and monotony of waiting while constantly fearing for one's life in an infernal and seemingly eternal battlefield.

Though also a bestseller at the time, Just David has rarely been reprinted since its release in 1916. We felt a story this good shouldn\u2019t be so hard to find, so we decided to put it back in print last year. Now it\u2019s in a longer-lasting hardcover.  It is the story of David, a charming little boy of 10 who is suddenly transplanted from a world of music (he plays the violin) in the mountains with his father, to the provincialism of a workaday small town. But even more, it is the story of how David transplants his own character, courage and happiness into the lives of the people he meets, and wins their love and respect. Here\u2019s what we say in the preface to the new edition:  Just David is a quiet, unassuming children\u2019s novel about an orphaned young boy with a mysterious past. David, not the typical boy found in most stories of his day, is a mixture of simplicity and complexity whose disarming innocence has a profound effect on the people he encounters. Unlike the \u201cgood bad boy\u201d often encountered in children\u2019s literature, David is a \u201cgood good\u201d boy. He is not in any way \u201cgoody-goody\u201d in the moralistic sense, but simply and purely good. David\u2019s goodness is not a mysterious quality that defies logic and imagination, but rather a quality cultivated in him by the intentional efforts of a wise and loving father. During David\u2019s formative years, his father secluded him from the influences of the outside world, creating a private world in the mountains filled with simple pleasures, purposeful study, and beautiful music. David\u2019s touching story is well within the scope of the imagination, and David\u2019s endearing innocence, engaging personality, and natural character are unforgettable.  Just David struck a resonant chord in our family for several reasons. First, David\u2019s life affirms the biblical principle expressed in the proverb, \u201cHe who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm\u201d. David walked with his father and became wise. Also, his story reminds us of the importance of creating the right \u201cappetite\u201d early in our children\u2019s lives. David\u2019s love of music, nature and beauty were intentionally cultivated in him by his father. Finally, there is a refreshing balance in David\u2019s life and character that provides a literary model to emulate, especially for the more artistically-inclined boy often overlooked in literature. David is artistic, yet he knows when to be realistic. He is slight of stature, yet able to handily defend himself when necessary. He is trained and mannerly, yet he is also manly. He is sensitive, yet sensible. Whatever limitations he discovers, he meets them with strength of character.  This is truly one of those books that everyone in your family will like, and will likely want to hear or read more than once. We\u2019re on our fourth reading! It has even inspired us to have Just David days for our children when we focus on the beautiful and lovely things God has given us to enjoy. Just David is just great. Includes family discussion questions at the end of the book.  --Whole Heart Ministries (less)","genre":"Classics, Fiction, Childrens, Historical, Historical Fiction","format":"hardcover","page":240.0,"isbn":9781888692051.0,"au_ge":"hplovecraft classics fiction childrens historical historicalfiction","key_words":"even decided workaday small town good bad boy often encountered emulate especially \u2019 profound effect david character encounters unlike quiet unassuming children given us wise grows simply importance happiness defies logic father secluded goodness beauty book pollyanna though also put beautiful life affirms story likely want fools suffers harm walked loving suddenly transplanted focus handily defend inspired great includes family discussion questions quality cultivated well within provides felt everyone necessary reprinted since mysterious wins right appetite early violin realistic intentionally lives discovers wonderful novel two years charming little trained artistically inclined overlooked people courage artistic yet world music intentional efforts meets strength stories walks mixture outside creating lovely things god manly preface days reminds say print last year enjoy simplicity like mountains filled past endearing innocence engaging personality biblical principle expressed end truly one moralistic sense stature able fourth reading refreshing balance respect hear touching proverb complexity whose disarming literature rather purely back bestseller provincialism whole heart ministries less imagination resonant chord rarely became orphaned young natural companion formative scope nature unforgettable day knows simple pleasures purposeful study new edition hard eleanor porter wrote runaway success find private slight longer lasting hardcover release typical found finally way goody love struck sensitive sensible whatever limitations books time plays mannerly read transplants literary model several reasons first influences","bow":"hplovecraft classics fiction childrens historical historicalfiction even decided workaday small town good bad boy often encountered emulate especially \u2019 profound effect david character encounters unlike quiet unassuming children given us wise grows simply importance happiness defies logic father secluded goodness beauty book pollyanna though also put beautiful life affirms story likely want fools suffers harm walked loving suddenly transplanted focus handily defend inspired great includes family discussion questions quality cultivated well within provides felt everyone necessary reprinted since mysterious wins right appetite early violin realistic intentionally lives discovers wonderful novel two years charming little trained artistically inclined overlooked people courage artistic yet world music intentional efforts meets strength stories walks mixture outside creating lovely things god manly preface days reminds say print last year enjoy simplicity like mountains filled past endearing innocence engaging personality biblical principle expressed end truly one moralistic sense stature able fourth reading refreshing balance respect hear touching proverb complexity whose disarming literature rather purely back bestseller provincialism whole heart ministries less imagination resonant chord rarely became orphaned young natural companion formative scope nature unforgettable day knows simple pleasures purposeful study new edition hard eleanor porter wrote runaway success find private slight longer lasting hardcover release typical found finally way goody love struck sensitive sensible whatever limitations books time plays mannerly read transplants literary model several reasons first influences"},{"titles":"Abraham Lincoln","authors":"Eleanor H.

People from around the world admire his eloquence as a spokesman for democracy and fighter for the oppressed. In this landmark biography, published fifty years after Lincoln's death, an English author recounted for his countrymen the remarkable story of Lincoln's life. Lord Charnwood's comprehensive biography, among the first major books about the sixteenth president, presents a sensitive and literate portrait, tracing Lincoln's rise from humble origins to the highest office in the land and recapturing the profound humanity of his character. From the grinding poverty of his boyhood in the backwoods of Kentucky and Indiana and his early struggles as a prairie lawyer, the author charts Lincoln's elevation to the Illinois legislature, Congress, and the presidency, culminating in his role as commander in chief during the bloodiest struggles in American history. Beautifully written, this unabridged edition also offers profound historical insights into the factors contributing to the Civil War, including economic and political conditions, territorial expansion, foreign and domestic policies, and slavery. This splendid profile of an epic figure whose relevance endures and grows with the passage of time is essential reading for admirers of Lincoln, students and scholars of American history, and anyone who appreciates a well-written, engrossing biography.

In this book he argues that the Roman Catholic Church is nothing more than pagan cult, with roots in Babylonian mystery cults, which have a bank of secret knowledge only available to those who have been formally accepted into the cult. Roman Catholics, Hislop argues, are descendants from early Christians who adopted the Roman religion descended from the worship of Semiramis, the wife of the founder of Babylon. By discrediting the true Christianity of Catholics, Hislop hoped to bolster the legitimacy of the Protestant and Scottish Reformations. Students of theology and those interested in the complex history of Christianity will find Hislop's arguments provocative enough that they may be moved to further research of their own.

Hill. Ourland is the sequel to Gilman's acclaimed feminist utopian novel Herland; both were published in her journal, The Forerunner, in 1915 and 1916. Ourland resumes the adventures of Herland's protagonists, Ellador and Van, but turns from utopian fantasy to a challenging analysis of contemporary social fissures in \"his land,\" or the real world. The republication of Herland as a separate novel in 1979 revived critical interest in Gilman's work but truncated the larger aims implicit in the Herland\/Ourland saga, leaving an erroneous understanding of Gilman's other\/better half of the story, in which it is suggested that strong women can resocialize men to be nurturant and cooperative. Gilman's choice of a sexually integrated society in With Her in Ourland provides us with her answer to her ideal society, but her foray into a woman-only society as a corrective to a male dominated one is a controversial option. The challenging message of Ourland, however, does not impede the pleasure of reading it as a novel.  Though known more for her fiction today, Gilman in her time was a recognized and accomplished sociologist who admired Lester F. Ward and frequently visited Jane Addams of Chicago's Hull-House. The male protagonist in Herland\/Ourland, Van, is a sociologist, used by Gilman as a foil on which to skewer the assumptions and practices of patriarchal sociology. The interpretation presented here, which adopts a sociological viewpoint, is invaluable reading for scholars and students of sociology, American women's studies, and utopian literature.
