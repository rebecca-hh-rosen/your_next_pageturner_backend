All of the original text, photographs and diagrams are preserved, and new text added providing updates in the progress of astronomy since the book was first published. Garrett Serviss wrote with a firm understanding of the science of the period. He was also graced with a delightful imagination and unequaled power of poetic expression in describing the wonders and mysteries of the universe. A few of the topics covered: * The strange unfixedness of the `fixed stars.' * The slow passing of the constellations. * The assembly of stars in immense clouds, swarms, and clusters. * The starless gaps in the Milky Way. * The marvelous phenomena of new, or temporary, stars. * The amazing forms of the whirlpool, spiral, pinwheel, and lace, or tress, nebulae. * The strange surroundings of the Sun. * The mystery of the Zodiacal Light and the Gegenschein. * The extraordinary transformations of comets and their tails. * The prodigies of meteorites and masses of stone and metal fallen from the sky. * The cataclysms that have wrecked the moon. * The problem of life and intelligence on Mars. * The problematical origin and fate of the asteroids. * The strange phenomena of the auroral lights.","genre":"Science, Science, Astronomy","format":null,"page":null,"isbn":null,"au_ge":"(pseudonym) science science astronomy","key_words":"moon gegenschein fixed stars mystery cataclysms prodigies intelligence auroral lights masses zodiacal light astronomy since describing meteorites slow passing new text added providing updates preserved constellations sun asteroids newly annotated edition metal fallen firm understanding wonders first published garrett serviss wrote comets whirlpool spiral pinwheel tails assembly book strange surroundings life stone progress also graced topics covered popular classic science clusters starless gaps marvelous phenomena amazing forms poetic expression temporary unfixedness extraordinary transformations problematical origin tress nebulae universe wrecked fate curiosities lace diagrams unequaled power problem delightful imagination mars immense clouds swarms mysteries sky original photographs period milky way","bow":"(pseudonym) science science astronomy moon gegenschein fixed stars mystery cataclysms prodigies intelligence auroral lights masses zodiacal light astronomy since describing meteorites slow passing new text added providing updates preserved constellations sun asteroids newly annotated edition metal fallen firm understanding wonders first published garrett serviss wrote comets whirlpool spiral pinwheel tails assembly book strange surroundings life stone progress also graced topics covered popular classic science clusters starless gaps marvelous phenomena amazing forms poetic expression temporary unfixedness extraordinary transformations problematical origin tress nebulae universe wrecked fate curiosities lace diagrams unequaled power problem delightful imagination mars immense clouds swarms mysteries sky original photographs period milky way"},{"titles":"Chivalry","authors":"Booth Tarkington","id":385809,"avg_rating":3.68,"tot_rating":40,"year_pub":"1909","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348436812l\/385809.jpg","description":"Inasmuch as it was by your command illustrious and exalted lady that I have gathered together these stories to form the present little book you should the less readily suppose I have presumed to dedicate to your Serenity this trivial offering because of my esteeming it to be not undeserving of your acce","genre":"Fantasy","format":"paperback","page":188.0,"isbn":9781426455995.0,"au_ge":"boothtarkington fantasy","key_words":"inasmuch present little book presumed exalted lady serenity undeserving form gathered together dedicate command illustrious less readily suppose esteeming acce stories trivial offering","bow":"boothtarkington fantasy inasmuch present little book presumed exalted lady serenity undeserving form gathered together dedicate command illustrious less readily suppose esteeming acce stories trivial offering"},{"titles":"The Island Pharisees","authors":"Garrett P.

In this highly readable but densely informative work, Waite, a preeminent 19th-century expert in esoterica, explores all the literature dedicated to this \"legend of the soul\" from both an intellectual and a spiritual perspective, seeking out the elemental through-lines of this most fundamental of stories as well as a mystical essence of Christianity itself. Students of folklore, readers of fantasy-quest fiction, and seekers after religious truth will all find this a vital resource. American-born British occultist and author ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE (1857-1942) was cocreator of the famous 1910 Rider-Waite Tarot deck.

The influence and popularity of Rilke\u2019s poetry in America have never been greater than they are today, more than fifty years after his death. Rilke is unquestionably the most significant and compelling poet of romantic transformation, of spiritual quest, that the twentieth century has known. His poems of ecstatic identification with the world exert a seemingly endless fascination for contemporary readers.  In Stephen Mitchell\u2019s versions, many readers feel that they have discovered an English rendering that captures the lyric intensity, fluency, and reach of Rilke\u2019s poetry more accurately and convincingly than has ever been done before.  Mr. Mitchell is impeccable in his adherence to Rilke\u2019s text, to his formal music, and to the complexity of his thoughts; at the same time, his work has authority and power as poetry in its own right. Few translators of any poet have arrived at the delicate balance of fidelity and originality that Mr. Mitchell has brought off with seeming effortlessness.

Eric Marshall, recent college graduate, has the world at his feet. He\u2019s handsome, popular, wealthy, and surprisingly, single. Living the bachelor lifestyle with his widowed father, he\u2019s never given much thought to romance. When an old school friend asks Eric to substitute teach for him on Prince Edward Island while he recuperates from an illness, Eric thinks, why not? He\u2019s got some time to kill before diving into the family business with his father, and the rustic island may be a good diversion for him.  Eric falls into the easy routine of island life, and his status as eligible bachelor endears him to the locals. Eric is still not thinking of romance, but he\u2019s about to find it in a most unexpected place\u2026  Kilmeny Gordon is sweet and smart and beautiful, perfect in every way but one: she can\u2019t speak. She\u2019s been sheltered all her life due to her disability and the scandal surrounding her birth. She wiles away her hours helping her aunt and uncle on the farm and playing her violin in her favorite secluded spot. When Eric stumbles into her hidden orchard, he brings a whole new world with him, and a friendship that both frightens her and thrills her. As the summer days grow longer and their friendship blossoms, sweet, silent Kilmeny, with her sunny enthusiasm and haunting music, manages to do what neither the co-eds of Queenslea College nor the village lasses of Lindsay have been able to do\u2014capture Eric\u2019s heart.

If...we could ask and it could reply, it would give up to us the most intimate secrets of life. -from Chapter II Anticipating not only modern scientific theories of psychology but also those of cosmology, this astonishing book sets out a impressive goal for itself: to reconcile human biology with a theory of consciousness. First published in France in 1907, and translated into English in 1911, this work of wonder was esteemed at the time in scientific circles and in the popular culture alike for its profound explorations of perception and memory and its surprising conclusions about the nature and value of art. Contending that intuition is deeper than intellect and that the real consequence of evolution is a mental freedom to grow, to change, to seek and create novelty, Bergson reinvigorated the theory of evolution by refusing to see it as merely mechanistic. His expansion on Darwin remains one of the most original and important philosophical arguments for a scientific inquiry still under fire today. French philosopher HENRI BERGSON (1859-1941) was born in Paris. Among his works are Matter and Memory (1896), An Introduction to Metaphysics (1903), and The Two Sources of Morality and Religion (1932).

His speculations, especially about the nature of time, had a profound influence on many other philosophers, as well as on poets and novelists; they are said to have been the seed for \u00c0 la recherce de temps perdu by Marcel Proust (whose cousin was Bergson's wife). Though his ideas were sometimes difficult to follow, Bergson was also a fine stylist, who once declared, \"there is nothing in philosophy which could not be said in everyday language,\" and who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927. In Time and Free Will, written as his doctoral thesis, Bergson tries to dispel the arguments against free will. These arguments, he shows, come from a confusion of different ideas of time. Physicists and mathematicians conceive of time as a measurable construct much like the spatial dimensions. But in human experience, life is perceived as a continuous and unmeasurable flow rather than as a succession of marked-off states of consciousness \u2014 something that can be measured not quantitatively, but only qualitatively. And because human personalities express themselves in acts that cannot be predicted, Bergson declares free will to be an observable fact. Students and teachers of philosophy are sure to welcome this inexpensive reprint of Bergson's classic, influential essay, long a staple of college philosophy courses.","genre":"Philosophy, Nonfiction, Cultural, France","format":"paperback","page":278.0,"isbn":9781402199394.0,"au_ge":"henribergson philosophy nonfiction cultural france","key_words":"welcome spatial dimensions said philosophical thought sure marked also poets arguing internationally known france novelists human experience life bergsons classic influential essay long time physicists staple many states marcel proust whose cousin different ideas philosophers abstract methods everyday language arguments rejecting traditional conceptual intuition seed measured written almost profound influence one sometimes difficult well predicted bergson declares free confusion inexpensive reprint wife though philosophy cannot \u00e0 la recherce de temps perdu revolution personalities express mathematicians conceive intellect day observable fact students succession continuous literature qualitatively lectures drew huge crowds henri led quantitatively measurable construct much like college courses shows come consciousness \u2014 something nothing follow acts teachers fine stylist dispel deeper could unmeasurable flow rather cult figure nature declared nobel prize doctoral thesis tries perceived awarded speculations especially","bow":"henribergson philosophy nonfiction cultural france welcome spatial dimensions said philosophical thought sure marked also poets arguing internationally known france novelists human experience life bergsons classic influential essay long time physicists staple many states marcel proust whose cousin different ideas philosophers abstract methods everyday language arguments rejecting traditional conceptual intuition seed measured written almost profound influence one sometimes difficult well predicted bergson declares free confusion inexpensive reprint wife though philosophy cannot \u00e0 la recherce de temps perdu revolution personalities express mathematicians conceive intellect day observable fact students succession continuous literature qualitatively lectures drew huge crowds henri led quantitatively measurable construct much like college courses shows come consciousness \u2014 something nothing follow acts teachers fine stylist dispel deeper could unmeasurable flow rather cult figure nature declared nobel prize doctoral thesis tries perceived awarded speculations especially"},{"titles":"Old Mother West Wind","authors":"Thornton W.
